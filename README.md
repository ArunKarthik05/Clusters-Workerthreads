WORKER THREAD
Worker threads are threads within a multithreaded application that are responsible for executing specific tasks or processes concurrently with other threads. In a multithreaded environment, such as in many modern software applications, multiple threads can run simultaneously, allowing the program to perform multiple tasks concurrently.

Worker threads are often used to handle tasks that can be executed independently and do not require the full attention of the main application thread. For example, in a web server application, worker threads might be responsible for handling incoming requests from clients, processing data, or performing background tasks such as database queries or file I/O operations.

By offloading these tasks to worker threads, the main application thread can remain responsive and available to handle user interactions or other high-priority tasks. Worker threads are typically managed by a thread pool, which dynamically allocates and manages a pool of threads to efficiently handle incoming tasks without the overhead of creating and destroying threads for each individual task.
